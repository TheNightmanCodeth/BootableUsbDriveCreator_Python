Bootable Usb Drive Creator - Python
==============================

>Mac only for now
>Linux is experimental. Aka it should work but I haven't tested it on my ubuntu partition yet

A simple script, written in Python 2.7.6, that I'm working on as an intro to python. Feel free to use my code, even though I don't see why you would want to, as long as you give me credit somewhere in your project(:

Usage
==============================
> python USBMaker.py

About
==============================
I made this script to start learning Python. It's a useful tool for me, and I figured I'd post my source in case any one wants to take a look and learn some python. For now, only mac and linux are supported. Windows support is coming soon.
